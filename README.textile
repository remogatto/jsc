h2. DESCRIPTION:

*Google Closure Compiler* is a pure Ruby REST API to "Google Closure Compiler service":http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/ and offers a simple and clear ruby API to the service.

As samples and part of the project this repository includes a Rakefile with some tasks. Check them!

h3. FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Ruby API actually is a single function call (ex: ClosureCompiler.compile(file_name, "statistics", "SIMPLE_OPTIMIZATIONS") )
* Handling of JSON responses, parse and print them (same output of the Google service web interface!)
* Handling of Server Errors responses
* Compile a file or a whole directory

Check the "API Reference":http://code.google.com/intl/it-IT/closure/compiler/docs/api-ref.html for more info about accepted parameters

h3. SYNOPSIS:

Coming soon

h3. REQUIREMENTS:

* No requirements

h3. INSTALL:

The library is a single file, so you can include it and just call the ClosureCompiler.compile(file_name, operations, compilation_level) function.

h3. RAKE TASKS

* Every task accepts a file name parameter
* A rake cc:compile['test.js'] task that execute every check with a single task (we may have some improvements)
* A rake cc:compile_dir['js'] task that execute a statistics check for every js file in a directory
