h2. Google Closure Compiler

This plugin is a pure Ruby REST API to "Google Closure Compiler service":http://code.google.com/closure/compiler/.
Its proposal is to offer a simple and clear ruby API to the service, you could use it in many ways even if at the moment it's just a one-day work :-)

As samples and part of the project this repository includes a Rakefile with some tasks and a bin file. Check them!

h3. Installing

The library is a single file, so you can include it and just call the ClosureCompiler.compile(file_name, operations) function, check for samples in the rake file.

h3. Features

* Ruby API actually is a single function call (ex: ClosureCompiler.compile(file_name, "statistics") )
* Handling of JSON responses, parse and print them (same output of the Google service web interface!)
* Handling of Server Errors responses

h3. Rake tasks

* Every task accepts a file name parameter
* A rake cc:compile['test.js'] task that execute every check with a single task (we may have some improvements)

h3. TODO

* Parameter for compilation level
* Create a gem (?)

h3. TASKS::TODO

* Improve compile task, execute every request in a single POST?
* Task to check every file in a folder
* Change the compile task with an :all task, how do I pass it a parameter?
